## Instructions



- For the data, right-click, "save/download file as..."
- Open the data
- Complete all of the tasks associated with that data and keep track of your answers / images
- **Once you are done**, go on Canvas and answer the questions related to the assignment
    - the Canvas assignment is **timed**; if you open it prior to completing the tasks you will run out of time





Skills used:

- Creating new variables
- Counting categories

::: {.callout-warning}
You must complete all of the tasks here BEFORE opening the Canvas quiz; otherwise, you will run out of time!

## Task 1: Combat Obscura


1. Connect the film we watched in class, *Combat Obscura*, to two of the readings we've covered in class so far. What parallels do you see? What is striking or interesting to you about the film? ~250 words. (5 points).

::: {.callout-note}
If you weren't able to attend lecture, or would like to review the film, it is available on Kanopy through UC Davis.

## Task 2: US casualties



Let's look at this data on American casualties in the Iraq and Afghanistan wars (variable dictionary below). Each row here is a soldier who died in one of these two wars.

- Download this: <i class="fas fa-download"></i> [iCasualties data](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/n5ha5rnqzoksm8yviovy0/casualties.csv?rlkey=w0syedcrxd8zyr45czh9a6ep8&dl=1)


2. Pick a row at random â€” look up the soldier online and see what you can find. What happened to this person? Who were they? (2 point)

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
df = read_csv("https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/n5ha5rnqzoksm8yviovy0/casualties.csv?rlkey=w0syedcrxd8zyr45czh9a6ep8&dl=1")
```



3. About what percent of casualties are the result of non-hostile actions (things like accidents, friendly fire, etc.)? Look at the `source` variable. (1 point)


```{r}
df |> group_by(source) |>
  tally() |>
  mutate(percent = n / sum(n) * 100) |>
  filter(source == "non-hostile")
```



4. What was the most common `cause` of death for US soldiers? (1 point)


```{r}
df |> group_by(cause) |>
  tally() |>
  arrange(desc(n))
```



8. Figure out how to use the `MONTH` function in excel / sheets to create a new column that tells you in what month the person died, based on the date of death variable. In what month of the year were the most American casualties registered?


```{r}
df |>
  mutate(month = month(date, label = TRUE)) |>
  group_by(month) |>
  tally() |>
  arrange(desc(n)) |>
  filter(n == max(n))
```
