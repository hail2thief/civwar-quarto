# Assignments



## Preparation

You will succeed in this class if you (1) attend lecture, (2) attend section, and (3) do the problem sets.


## Problem sets

To practice working with data you will complete problem sets throughout the quarter. Feel free to work together on the problem sets but **you must turn in your own answers to Canvas.** You cannot work in groups of more than **three** people.


## Exams

We will hold midterm and final exams. The exams will be in-person. The format will either be multiple choice (scantrons) or written (blue books) or a combination of the two.


# The rules


## Honor Code

Be nice. Don't cheat. The [Code of Academic Conduct](https://ossja.ucdavis.edu/code-academic-conduct) is in effect in this class and all others at the University. I will treat violations seriously. If you have doubts, it is your responsibility to ask about the Codeâ€™s application.


## ChatGPT (and other LLMs)

The world is still figuring out how to deal with large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT. My view is that ChatGPT is not functionally different from searching online forums, Google, etc., for help with how to complete tasks. Looking up how to do things online is *good practice*, so I don't want to discourage that.  

* **what is allowed**. You are allowed to use ChatGPT to figure out how to complete **data analysis** tasks (e.g., how do I make a barplot in Excel?). 
* **what is not allowed**. You are not allowed to pass off ChatGPT's **writing** as if it was your own (e.g., submitting ChatGPT's interpretation of some graph or data pattern). 
* **Be careful**. In my experience, these machines can give answers that are way off. Plus, if you over rely on them and don't develop an understanding of the material, you'll likely suffer during the in-class exams. 


## Grade disputes

If you believe that you received the wrong grade on an assignment or exam:

-   send an email specifying **exactly** which questions you believe were graded incorrectly, and provide **specific** justification for why your answer is the correct one. We will then regrade your entire assignment. Your grade may go up, down, or stay the same
-   I will **only accept grade appeals up to three days after the posting of a grade**


### Extensions on assignments

You can turn in the problem set/weekly check-in one day late, no questions asked, though you will lose a full letter-grade. Beyond that I will not accept late assignments without a doctor's note, so don't ask!
