Each row in this dataset is a person who answered the survey. To keep things simple, I've subsetted the data to only respondents from the four major ethnic groups in the country. \n\n\n- Download this: <i class=\"fas fa-download\"></i> [Ethiopia Afrobarometer subset](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/waw4z31ax01y8m5jj9lu7/ethiopia-afrobarom.csv?rlkey=9tq49zlvkh3g4va70ra9d1pq6&dl=1)\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n1. One of the questions in the survey pertains to a controversy about the national emblem at the center of the Ethiopian flag (the blue star) and whether it should be removed or kept. Google around. What is the emblem? And why is it controversial? (3 points) \n\n\n2. How do Ethiopians feel, in general, about their system of ethnic federalism? Calculate the PERCENT of respondents who gave each answer to the `ethnic_federalism` question. What percent agree or strongly agree with keeping the system \"as is\"? (1 point)\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n3. Perform the same calculation as above, but grouped by the respondent `ethnicity`. Which ethnic group has the largest percent of people who agree or strongly agree with keeping the system as is? (1 point)\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n4. Why would this be? Discuss, based on lecture and readings, why this group would favor keeping the system as is. (2 points)\n\n\n5. What percent of people in our survey live in a state that matches their ethnicity? Figure out how to use `IF` to construct a variable that equals 1 if the person lives in a region that matches their ethnicity (e.g., an Oromo who lives in the Oromo region) and 0 otherwise. The average of this variable will tell you what PROPORTION of respondents live in a region that matches their ethnicity. (1 point)\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n6. What PERCENT of people speak the most commonly spoken language in the sample? (1 point)\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n7. Among the three constitutional amendments being considered (right to secession, changing the flag, and adding new languages), which has the FEWEST respondents who either oppose or strongly oppose?
