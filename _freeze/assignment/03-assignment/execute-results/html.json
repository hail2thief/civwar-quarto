The dataset is called the Geo-referenced Event Dataset (GED) which provides detailed geo-referenced information on violent events around the world. \n\n- Download this: <i class=\"fas fa-download\"></i> [UCDP GED Dataset](https://www.dropbox.com/s/6tthe5o22lgglkp/ucdp-ged-small.csv?dl=1)\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n      Variable                Description         \n--------------------- ----------------------------\n         id              Unique event identifer   \n\n        year                Year event began      \n\n        month              Month event began      \n\n         day                Day event began       \n\n       country              Country of event      \n\n  type_of_violence         UCDP violence type     \n\n    conflict_name           Name of conflict      \n\n       side_a                    Side A           \n\n       side_b                    Side B           \n\n   source_article       Article event came from   \n\n      latitude                  Latitude          \n\n      longitude                Longitude          \n\n low_death_estimate    Low estimate of number of  \n                                 deaths           \n\n high_death_estimate   High estimate of number of \n                                 deaths           \n\n best_death_estimate         Best estimate        \n--------------------------------------------------\n:::\n\n\n\n\nWe're going to use this geo-coded data to map all the violent events in a country in a year of your choosing. Here's how to do this:\n\n\n- Look through the data a bit\n\n- filter the data to a year and country of your choosing, being careful that your selection does not result in too few rows (you want at least 100 rows)\n\n- select only these columns: `type_of_violence`,\t`latitude`,\t`longitude`,\t`best_death_estimate`\n\n- paste them into a new spreadsheet, then File --> Download that spreadsheet as a `.csv` file (in Excel you would \"save as\" -> file format -> .csv)\n\n- Go to this [very ugly yet masterful website](https://www.gpsvisualizer.com/map_input?form=data) and on the left, upload your csv file under \"File #1\"\n\n    - Look at the \"data point options\" section of that same page\n    \n    - set `colorize this field` to custom field and then write in \"type_of_violence\"\n    \n    - set the \"resize using this field\" option to \"custom field\" and then write in \"best_death_estimate\"\n    \n    - finally, bottom left, hit \"draw the map\"\n    \n    - Screencap the map so you can turn it in\n\n\n1. Spend some time looking at the map you have generated, you can also click on the points. It helps to have Google Maps open in a separate tab to get a better sense for what you are looking at. Now, reflect on what you are seeing. Which country did you pick? Where are these attacks concentrated? How do they relate to the country's geography? Where are they in relation to the capital, to its borders? Are there patterns in the number of deaths, or the type of violence? Describe what you see in 2-3 paragraphs.

You are going to work with the [Rebel Contraband Dataset](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/iu755ks5lcgow7gr43uzo/contraband.csv?rlkey=f3z2gn0ub9oqkfuilcsbf64jj&dl=1). Each observation in this dataset is a year in which a rebel group was engaged in conflict with the state. We refer to each row as a *conflict-year*. \n\n\nUsing the dataset, answer the following questions:\n\n\n2. Across the whole dataset, approximately what percent of conflict-years relied on extortion? (1 point)\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n3. Calculate the percent of conflict-years that relied on the extortion of alluvial diamonds, broken down by country. In which country was this funding strategy the most common? (1 point)\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\n4. How have coca smuggling trends changed over time? Use a pivot table to find the percent of conflicts with coca smuggling *for each year* in the data. Plot the results as a line graph and screencap the image (you will upload). (1 point)\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n4. How have coca smuggling trends changed over time? Briefly interpret the graph. (1 point)\n\n\n\n5. Do groups that abduct their members rely on smuggling at higher or lower rates than groups that don't abduct? Calculate the percent of rebel groups that use smuggling, comparing groups that do and don't rely on abduction. What is the difference in smuggling use between groups that use abduction and those that don't? Report as a difference in percentage points ($\\%Smuggling_{abduction=yes} - \\%Smuggling_{abduction=no}$) (1 point)\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n     Variable                Description          \n------------------ -------------------------------\n     country                   Country            \n\n       year                     Year              \n\n      sidea           Side A in conflict (UCDP)   \n\n      sideb           Side B in conflict (UCDP)   \n\n      region             Region of the world      \n\n    extortion       Did group use extortion?
