The dataset contains information on major civil wars around the world for a select time period.  -->\n\n\n<!-- - The data: <i class=\"fas fa-download\"></i> [Kalyvas and Balcells](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/rpqb5sryxp5wqeivjqui2/balcells-kalyvas.csv?rlkey=jysyuzvj4xvhv6yzpn1jiepdq&dl=1) -->\n\n\n<!-- ```{r, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, results='asis', eval=TRUE} -->\n<!-- library(tidyverse) -->\n<!-- # dictionary -->\n<!-- tribble(~Variable, ~Description,  -->\n<!--         \"countryname\", \"Country where civil war takes place\", -->\n<!--         \"year/month_start\", \"Year/month war began\", -->\n<!--         \"year/month_end\", \"Year/month war ended (if at all)\", -->\n<!--         \"conflict_name\", \"Name of conflict\", -->\n<!--         \"region\", \"World region\", -->\n<!--         \"gdp_capita\", \"GDP per capita (logged)\", -->\n<!--         \"rough_terrain\", \"Percent of country covered in rough terrain\", -->\n<!--         \"military_personnel_percapita\", \"Military personnel, in thousands\", -->\n<!--         \"marxist\", \"Is rebellion Marxist?\", -->\n<!--         \"technologyrebellion\", \"What kind of civil war is it?\", -->\n<!--         \"ethnicwar\", \"Is this an ethnic civil war?\") %>%  -->\n<!--   pander::pandoc.table() -->\n\n<!-- ``` -->\n\n\n\n<!-- ## Questions -->\n\n\n<!-- Using the dataset, answer the following questions: -->\n\n\n<!-- 1. Choose a civil war of each **type** in the dataset and look it up on Wikipedia. Provide a non-technical, 2 sentence description of each war. (total = 3 wars, 2 sentences each). (2 points) -->\n\n\n\n<!-- 2. Sort the data. Which country had the largest army per capita involved in a civil war? (1 point) -->\n\n<!-- ```{r} -->\n<!-- library(tidyverse) -->\n<!-- df = read_csv(\"https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/rpqb5sryxp5wqeivjqui2/balcells-kalyvas.csv?rlkey=jysyuzvj4xvhv6yzpn1jiepdq&dl=1\") -->\n<!-- df |>  -->\n<!--   arrange(desc(military_personnel_percapita)) -->\n<!-- ``` -->\n\n\n\n<!-- 3. Count the number of civil wars by region. Which region has the highest number of recorded civil wars? (1 point) -->\n\n<!-- ```{r, eval = FALSE} -->\n<!-- df$region |> table() -->\n<!-- ``` -->\n\n\n<!-- 4. Cross-tabulate the number of civil wars across `warfare technology` and whether or not it's an `ethnic` conflict. How many civil wars are both \"conventional\" and ethnically motivated? (1 point) -->\n\n\n<!-- ```{r, eval = FALSE} -->\n<!-- table(df$technologyrebellion, df$ethnicwar) -->\n<!-- ``` -->\n\n\n\n\n<!-- 5. Create a variable that tells you how long each civil war has lasted, using only the years column (year ended - year started. Note: don't worry about civil wars that don't have a start or end date, you can ignore this issue). In which country did the *THIRD* longest lasting civil war take place? (1 point) -->\n\n\n<!-- ```{r} -->\n<!-- df |>  -->\n<!--   mutate(duration = year_end - year_start) |>  -->\n<!--   arrange(desc(duration)) -->\n<!-- ``` -->\n\n\n<!-- 6. Filter this analysis down so you're only looking at Latin America. What is the SECOND longest conflict in this region? (1 point) -->\n\n<!-- ```{r} -->\n<!-- df |>  -->\n<!--   filter(region == \"Lamerica\") |>  -->\n<!--   mutate(duration = year_end - year_start) |>  -->\n<!--   arrange(desc(duration)) -->\n<!-- ``` -->\n\n\n<!-- 7. We we will frequently talk about civil wars \"starting\" and \"ending\" in this class, but figuring out exactly *when* this happens is tricky. If you were to design a rule for deciding when a civil war has **begun**, what would that rule be? What would you have to observe, exactly, to say that a war has broken out? (3 points) -->\n\n<!--     A) describe your rule, make it as specific as possible. For example: \"*We can say that a civil war has begun when X, Y, and Z happens...*\" -->\n\n<!--     B) Identify some \"edge cases\" that will cause trouble for that rule. 4-5 sentences.  -->",
