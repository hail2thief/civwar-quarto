The dataset contains information on major civil wars around the world for a select time period. Every row here is a civil conflict. \n\n\n- The data: <i class=\"fas fa-download\"></i> [Kalyvas and Balcells](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/rpqb5sryxp5wqeivjqui2/balcells-kalyvas.csv?rlkey=jysyuzvj4xvhv6yzpn1jiepdq&dl=1)\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n           Variable                      Description          \n------------------------------ -------------------------------\n         countryname            Country where civil war takes \n                                            place             \n\n       year/month_start             Year/month war began      \n\n        year/month_end           Year/month war ended (if at  \n                                            all)              \n\n        conflict_name                 Name of conflict        \n\n            region                      World region          \n\n          gdp_capita               GDP per capita (logged)    \n\n        rough_terrain           Percent of country covered in \n                                        rough terrain         \n\n military_personnel_percapita      Military personnel, in     \n                                          thousands           \n\n           marxist                  Is rebellion Marxist?     \n\n     technologyrebellion        What kind of civil war is it? \n\n          ethnicwar             Is this an ethnic civil war?  \n--------------------------------------------------------------\n:::\n\n\n\n\n## Questions\n\n\nUsing the dataset, answer the following questions:\n\n\n1. Choose a civil war of each **type** in the dataset and look it up on Wikipedia. Provide a non-technical, 2 sentence description of each war. (total = 3 wars, 2 sentences each). (2 points)\n\n\n\n2. Sort the data. Which COUNTRY had the largest army per capita involved in a civil war? (1 point)\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\n3. Count the number of civil wars by region. Which REGION has the SECOND highest number of recorded civil wars? (1 point)\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n4. Create a cross-tab of `warfare technology` and `ethnic` conflict. How many civil wars are both \"conventional\" and NOT ethnically motivated? (1 point)\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n5. Create a variable that tells you how long each civil war has lasted, using only the years column (year ended - year started. Note: don't worry about civil wars that don't have a start or end date, you can ignore this issue). In which country did the *THIRD* longest lasting civil war take place? (1 point)\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n6. Filter this analysis down so you're only looking at sub-Saharan Africa. What is the longest CONFLICT in this region? (1 point)\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n7. We we will frequently talk about civil wars \"starting\" and \"ending\" in this class, but figuring out exactly *when* this happens is tricky. If you were to design a rule for deciding when a civil war has **begun**, what would that rule be? What would you have to observe, exactly, to say that a war has broken out? (3 points)\n\n    A) describe your rule, make it as specific as possible. For example: \"*We can say that a civil war has begun when X, Y, and Z happens...*\"\n\n    B) Identify some \"edge cases\" that will cause trouble for that rule. 4-5 sentences.",
