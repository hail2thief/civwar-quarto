Connect the film we watched in class, *Combat Obscura*, to two of the readings we've covered in class so far. What parallels do you see? What is striking or interesting to you about the film? ~250 words. (5 points).\n\n\n## Task 2: US casualties\n\n\n\nLet's look at this data on American casualties in the Iraq and Afghanistan wars (variable dictionary below). Each row here is a soldier who died in one of these two wars. \n\n- Download this: <i class=\"fas fa-download\"></i> [iCasualties data](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/n5ha5rnqzoksm8yviovy0/casualties.csv?rlkey=w0syedcrxd8zyr45czh9a6ep8&dl=1)\n\n\n2. Pick a random row/observation â€” look up the soldier online and see what you can find. What happened to this person? Who were they? (2 point) \n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\n3. About what percent of casualties are the result of non-hostile actions (things like accidents, friendly fire, etc.)? Look at the `source` variable. (1 point)\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\n4. What was the most common `cause` of death for US soldiers? (1 point)\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\n8. Figure out how to use the `MONTH` function in excel / sheets to create a new column that tells you in what month the person died, based on the date of death variable. In what month of the year were the most American casualties registered?\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n-------------------------------------------------\n    Variable               Description           \n---------------- --------------------------------\n      date                Date of death          \n\n      name               Name of soldier         \n\n      rank               Rank of soldier         \n\n  nationality         Nationality of soldier     \n\n     branch             Branch of military       \n\n      age                  Age at death          \n\n    country       Country (Iraq or Afghanistan)  \n\n    province       Province where soldier died   \n\n     where        City/locale where soldier died \n\n     source        Source of death (hostile or   \n                           non-hostile)          \n\n     cause                Cause of death         \n\n     state            Home state of soldier      \n\n      city          Home city/town of soldier    \n\n state_pop_2010     Population in state (2010)   \n-------------------------------------------------\n:::",
