One such group is the \"Red Guards\", who have chapters in a few different cities of the United States. \n\nThese groups are mostly secretive so we don't know that much about how they work or what they do. However, in a surprising turn of events, a number of disgruntled members of a Red Guard group [made a website](https://maoistcultexposed.wordpress.com/cr-cpusa-expose/) where they claim to \"expose\" the inner workings of their organization and leak some primary documents. Keep in mind: these are disgruntled members (they claim the organization is a \"cult\"), and we cannot verify everything they are saying. Take what you read with a grain of salt. \n\n\nRead through the website and Google the group some to answer the following questions:\n\n\n1. Why do they call themselves the \"Red Guards\"? What is that name a reference to? What does that tell us about their ideology? Explain in 3-4 sentences. (2 points)\n\n\n\n2. Using direct quotes from the website (see: \"Defining Terms\"): what did the group's ideology consist of? What were its political goals? Explain in 4-6 sentences. (3 points)\n\n\n\n\n3. How was the organization structured internally? What were the different positions / roles that members had? Use direct quotes from the site (see: \"Leadership and organization\"). Explain in 4-6 sentences. (3 points)\n\n\n4. There is a point at which the disgruntled members claim that the organization ultimately collapses due to internal tensions / disagreements. What were these tensions/disagreements? What instigated this collapse (see: \"Timeline\")? Use direct quotes from the site. Discuss in 4-6 sentences. (3 points)\n\n\n\n\n",
