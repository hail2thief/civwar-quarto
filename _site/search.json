You are allowed to use ChatGPT to figure out how to complete data analysis tasks (e.g., how do I make a barplot in Excel?).\nwhat is not allowed. You are not allowed to pass off ChatGPT’s writing as if it was your own (e.g., submitting ChatGPT’s interpretation of some graph or data pattern).\nBe careful. In my experience, these machines can give answers that are way off. Plus, if you over rely on them and don’t develop an understanding of the material, you’ll likely suffer during the in-class exams."

Each week will be organized around a different topic related to the study of civil wars, including why civil wars break out, the tactics insurgents and states use during wars, what happens when third-parties intervene, whether negotiations can effectively end wars, and other key questions in the conflict literature.\nIn addition to reading, we will also spend a significant amount of time in this class working with data on political violence. We will explore general patterns and trends, think about how to measure different concepts related to political violence, and see to what extent different theories of political violence are supported by evidence.\nBy the end of this course, you will be able to:\n\nIdentify structural and historical drivers of violence\nThink about civil war as a strategic process involving states, civilians, and armed groups\nExplore, analyze, and interpret data bearing on political violence\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe class assumes no prior experience working with data"

Googling the article is often enough, otherwise Google Scholar and being either on campus wi-fi or on the library VPN should do the trick. If you’re stuck the TAs will be happy to help.\n\n\nGoogle Sheets\nAll homework requiring data will be done in Google Sheets or Excel. Google Sheets is free to use with a Google account, and I will do all data analysis tutorials in Google Sheets. However, you can easily follow along with whatever program you prefer.\n\n\nPodcasts\nYou should listen to podcasts, although I won’t grade you on it. Here are some of my favorite podcasts that frequently discuss politics and history in Latin America:\n\nWOLA\nThe Daily\nRevolutions\nLa Silla Vacia (for Spanish speakers)"
