You are allowed to use ChatGPT to figure out how to complete data analysis tasks (e.g., how do I make a barplot in Excel?).\nwhat is not allowed. You are not allowed to pass off ChatGPT’s writing as if it was your own (e.g., submitting ChatGPT’s interpretation of some graph or data pattern).\nBe careful. In my experience, these machines can give answers that are way off. Plus, if you over rely on them and don’t develop an understanding of the material, you’ll likely suffer during the in-class exams."

Each week will be organized around a different topic related to the study of civil wars, including why civil wars break out, the tactics insurgents and states use during wars, what happens when third-parties intervene, whether negotiations can effectively end wars, and other key questions in the conflict literature.\nIn addition to reading, we will also spend a significant amount of time in this class working with data on political violence. We will explore general patterns and trends, think about how to measure different concepts related to political violence, and see to what extent different theories of political violence are supported by evidence.\nBy the end of this course, you will be able to:\n\nIdentify structural and historical drivers of violence\nThink about civil war as a strategic process involving states, civilians, and armed groups\nExplore, analyze, and interpret data bearing on political violence\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe class assumes no prior experience working with data"

Google Sheets is free to use with a Google account, and I will do all data analysis tutorials in Google Sheets.

    "text": "Task 1: The geography of war\nYou’re going to work with a random sample from the Uppsala Conflict Data Program at The Department of Peace and Conflict Research, Uppsala University in Oslo, Norway. The dataset is called the Geo-referenced Event Dataset (GED) which provides detailed geo-referenced information on violent events around the world.\n\nDownload this:  UCDP GED Dataset\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nid\nUnique event identifer\n\n\nyear\nYear event began\n\n\nmonth\nMonth event began\n\n\nday\nDay event began\n\n\ncountry\nCountry of event\n\n\ntype_of_violence\nUCDP violence type\n\n\nconflict_name\nName of conflict\n\n\nside_a\nSide A\n\n\nside_b\nSide B\n\n\nsource_article\nArticle event came from\n\n\nlatitude\nLatitude\n\n\nlongitude\nLongitude\n\n\nlow_death_estimate\nLow estimate of number of deaths\n\n\nhigh_death_estimate\nHigh estimate of number of deaths\n\n\nbest_death_estimate\nBest estimate\n\n\n\n\nWe’re going to use this geo-coded data to map all the violent events in a country in a year of your choosing. Here’s how to do this:\n\nLook through the data a bit\nfilter the data to a year and country of your choosing, being careful that your selection does not result in too few rows (you want at least 100 rows)\nselect only these columns: type_of_violence, latitude, longitude, best_death_estimate\npaste them into a new spreadsheet, then File –&gt; Download that spreadsheet as a .csv file (in Excel you would “save as” -&gt; file format -&gt; .csv)\nGo to this very ugly yet masterful website and on the left, upload your csv file under “File #1”\n\nLook at the “data point options” section of that same page\nset colorize this field to custom field and then write in “type_of_violence”\nset the “resize using this field” option to “custom field” and then write in “best_death_estimate”\nfinally, bottom left, hit “draw the map”\nScreencap the map so you can turn it in\n\n\n\nSpend some time looking at the map you have generated, you can also click on the points. It helps to have Google Maps open in a separate tab to get a better sense for what you are looking at. Now, reflect on what you are seeing. Which country did you pick? Where are these attacks concentrated? How do they relate to the country’s geography? Where are they in relation to the capital, to its borders? Are there patterns in the number of deaths, or the type of violence? Describe what you see in 2-3 paragraphs. (5 points)"
